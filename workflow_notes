macros %>% filter out damaged individuals affecting measurement
# how many have equations?

Temperature %>% filter out >= 200 days of temperature measurements

Model data N ~ M * DD + (1 + DD | SiteID) + (1 | year)
Allow for random slopes by site, and random intercepts by site and year

Assess model fit
- plot priors vs posteriors
- pp_check
_ plot 95% fit interval and observed points
- RMSE/MSPE
- plot change in slope across sites?

Predict 2019 model
- RSME/MSPE
- plot 95% prediction interval and observed points

Predict 2017/2018 data with no temperature data
- median temperature values from modeled data
- use "re_formula" or similar to predict sites witout temperature variable?
- or make a generic model without temperature and compare predictive ability?

Predict other data set- McGarvey and Kirk
- look up degree days for sampling event
- plot prediction interval and observed sites
- ~ same relationship && change in intercept --> justify investigating effects of productivity on community abundance (intercept)
