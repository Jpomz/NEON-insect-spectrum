Notes:

Filter out damaged individuals when measurement is affected?
2018 ~ 15.6% of observations are damaged
str_subset(macro$inv_taxonomyProcessed$sampleCondition, "measurement")
Run models with and without
--> need to rerun script 1 and remove damaged individuals, re-bin, join temp, etc. 

Filter out smallest and largest individuals?

LW coeffs:
what percent of data has LW coefs?
Find more equations to complete this?
~right now its at ~95%, I think we're good

Temperature data:
Only for wadeable streams --> looks like nonwadeable streams and lake temps are in DP1.20264.001

what to do when significant observations are missing? Filter out so only using sites with full years of data?
[DECISION 6/19] filter out sites that have >=200 days of temperature observations --> only lose 6 sampling events

NOTE!!!!
Temperature data download as of ~7/7 changed. I didn't save orginal download, so not sure exactly what changed, but I do know that we did have ~90 site:season:year combinations that had > 200 daily temperature observations, and now we only have ~8. 
I emailed NEON on 7/9, but have not yeat heard back. I'm hoping this is a glitch and the data will come back and that it wasn't erroneous or removed for QA/QC or something. 

Functions:
Continue testing est_dw() function
make an RMSE function?

to do list (6/18/20):
1) download data - done
2) wrangle data - need to filter out damaged - done
3) model data - decide which models to test / select / average
  model 1 in 2a is best (N~M*dd(1|site)(1|year))
4) predict 2019 data
5) assess predictions / model performance / RMSE

6/23 --> read up on RMSE


Predicting for unknown values (i.e. degree_days in AMD data) estimate with mean(), or possibly implement some bayesian method to impute degree_days value from distribution?

McGarvey Kirk: # "correct" mcgarvey intercepts so they match NEON, see if slopes are the same?
